# ZeroDivisionError in Python Average Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError.  The `bug.py` file contains code that attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers. If the list is empty, it leads to a division by zero exception.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles the empty list case. 

The ZeroDivisionError is a runtime exception raised when a division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.  Always include checks to prevent such errors.
